Here's a joke - _token but how to ken_.

I have been taken down by blockchain fever. Overpowered by ideas of
decentralisation.

Here's a question â€“ How could we introduce token dynamics to create an ecosystem
around offline community/event?

This repo is an experiment. We will use this as a playground to explore possible
incentives for all involved actors and try to come up with a cryptoeconomy which
above all directly benefits the community at large and makes it self governed.

The initial experiments will be ordinary apps. Tokens will be simulated.

But along the way, we will deploy them to blockchain networks and introduce
smart contracts. Basically, dApp the app.

## Scene I: Lets gather together

We start with a referral and a checkin system. A user can connect their
FB/Twitter/\*social account to refer events to their friends/peers.

Whenever they attend these offline events, there will be a way for them to
check-in and earn tokens. And you guessed it. If anybody you referred attends,
you get tokens.
